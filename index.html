            <p class="intro">Native Iowa trees are great to consider planting in your yard. Native trees are good for the environment and help to restore Iowa's natural beauty. "Native" means that they have been occurring in this region for a long time, and can withstand the climate better than others that have been introduced to the zone. Because these trees are well adapted to the area, they are lower maintenance, preserve biodiversity, and require less water. The trees listed below are some of the fastest-growing natives that look the best in landscapes with all four seasons considered.</p>
